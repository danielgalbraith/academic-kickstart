I'm a Linguist at Google. I enjoy working on cutting-edge NLP and all kinds of problems involving human language. I graduated from Stanford with a PhD in Linguistics (2018). I am excited about applying deep knowledge of how language works to useful projects in the tech industry.

I spent the last several years dedicated to human language research, developing a new approach to syntax. During PhD, I sourced, annotated and analysed large quantities of new linguistic data, using statistical and computational methods. You can see machine learning projects and research tools I built at [my Github](http://github.com/danielgalbraith).
